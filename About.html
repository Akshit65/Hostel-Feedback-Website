        About</span> Hostel DSU</h1>
        <p>'A home away from home', is the concept of hostels in DSU. We provide the best possible comfort needed for students. The number of students accommodated in a room depends on the semester. As the concentration and privacy required is more as a student progress from first year to final year, accordingly the accommodation is provided.</p>

      <p>"This hostel is absolutely superb, the staff are friendly, helpful, full of local knowledge and go the extra mile. The facilities are cleaned daily, rooms are spacious, large lockers for the bigger backpacks, free wireless internet in the lounge with some computers also connected to the internet, with a large screen TV (which was popular most evenings) Breakfast is good and a real bonus is a 6.30pm snack, which can range from pizza to some lovingly prepared sandwiches. The hostel is closed off everyday between 11am and 2pm for cleaning but the owners are very flexible on that rule, just inform them first if you need to get some stuff done."</p>

      <p>"This was my first solo hostel stay experience. The location of Academy Hostel is fantastic, you really are in the centre of town surrounded by cathedrals (if you're a light sleeper like me, I might suggest bringing ear plugs.) As I visited during winter, there were fewer guests and it was a little harder to spark conversation in the communal couch area, but I suspect this would be easier in summer. The rooms were basic, clean and comfortable and I very much appreciated the help and hospitality of the staff with my requests."</p>
